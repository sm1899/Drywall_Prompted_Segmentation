Prompted Segmentation for Drywall QA
Goal
Train (or at least fine-tune) a text-conditioned segmentation model so that, given an image
and a natural-language prompt, it produces a binary mask for:
● “segment crack” (Dataset 2: Cracks)
● “segment taping area” (Dataset 1: Drywall-Join-Detect)
Datasets
● Dataset 1 (Taping area):
https://universe.roboflow.com/objectdetect-pu6rn/drywall-join-detect
Map to prompt: “segment taping area”, “segment joint/tape”, “segment drywall
seam”...
● Dataset 2 (Cracks): https://universe.roboflow.com/fyp-ny1jt/cracks-3ii36
Map to prompt: “segment crack”, “segment wall crack”..
Prediction masks
● PNG, single-channel, same spatial size as source image, values {0,255}.
● Filenames include image id and prompt, e.g. 123__segment_crack.png.
Report
● Mention approach, model tried
● Short goal summary, data split counts, metrics, 3–4 visual examples (orig | GT |
pred), brief failure notes, runtime & footprint (train time, avg inference time/image,
model size).
Grading Rubric (100 pts)
● Correctness (50): mIoU & Dice on both prompts.
● Consistency (30): Stable across varied scenes.
● Presentation (20): Clear README; seeds noted. Clear report + tables + visuals.
